# tinder_clone

This project is part of the Masterclass course for learning the Dart language and the Flutter SDK.

## Getting Started
This project consists of setting up a screen similar to the one used by App Tinder. It does not have navigation between screens, since the objective of this project is to learn how to use widgets and how they can be arranged on the device's screen.
